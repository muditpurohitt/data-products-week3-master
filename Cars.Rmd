## Mileage of car

Ww will try to understand the milage of cars using `mtcars` dataset by creating a plot.

Plot- weight (`wt`)(X) vs. mileage (`mpg`)(Y).
Number of cylinders (`cyl`) - colors. 
Amount of horsepower (`hp`) - size of a point.

##  Data visualisation.

```{r plot, echo=FALSE}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(plotly))
plot_ly(data = mtcars, x = ~wt, y = ~mpg, 
        color = ~as.factor(cyl), size = ~hp,
        text = ~paste("Weight: ", wt, '<br>MPG:', mpg),
        type = "scatter", mode = "markers") %>%
  layout(title = "Data of cars")
```
